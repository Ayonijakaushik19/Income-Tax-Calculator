Why 2 Types of Taxes ?

The Budget 2020 saw the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announce a new tax regime with more tax slabs and lower tax rates.
This was long demanded by most taxpayers, but it came with the catch of removal of all the deductions and exemptions that
were available under the old tax regime.To add to this confusion, the finance minister gave taxpayers a choice between the
new regime and the existing one, leaving it to them to decide which they would like to opt for.
All these factors acting together,instead of tax laws getting simpler, they are now more complex.

What are Old Tax  ?

By Old Tax regimes, We mean Taxes or the Tax Slab that was being utilized by the Tax player before 2020.
In the budget 2020,the Finance minister of India has passed a resolution that the Taxpayer now has a choice for accepting the old or new
Tax slabs as per the needs Over the years the government,through the addition of clauses to the Income Tax Act, has given
Indian taxpayers over 70 exemptions and deduction options through which they can bring down their taxable income and hence pay less.
While exemptions are part of your salary, like the House Rent Allowance (HRA) and Leave Travel Allowance (LTA), deductions
allow you to lower your tax amount by investing,saving, or spending on specific items.
The biggest section for deduction is Section 80c through which you can bring down your taxable income by Rs.1.5 lakh.
Apart from this, several other sections let you take tax deductions on things ranging from interest on your loans (home and education)
to premiums you pay for health insurance.

What are New Tax  ?

The new tax regime is different from the old tax regime in two aspects.
One, in the new regime, the number of tax slabs has increased, accompanied by lowering of rates in the sub-Rs 15 lakh range.
Two, all the exemptions and deductions that were being used by taxpayers in the existing regime won't be available in the new regime.
